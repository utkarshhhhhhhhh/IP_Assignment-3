Advantages Of Using OO:
1.) The code is simple to understand. Walking through the code becomes very easy as the reading and accessibility of the code is much-much simpler instead of using dictionaries and other suitable file structures.
2.) Moreover, addition of various other features becomes very easy as much of our requirements are fullfuilled beforehand.

Disadvantages Of Using OO:
1.) OOPs is a tough concept to get grasp of....
2.) Keeping in mind of every function and variables is a very hectic task.

Advantages Of Using Dictionaries:
1.) Codes done using dictionaries are uually short and simpler.
2.) Codes using dictionaries are usually better to write with as they are as they are a simpler data structure.

Disadvantages Of Using Dictionaries:
1.) Debugging and Error finding of code is a gigantic task.
2.) Using features like nesting of dictionaries,list,etc is a very difficult task.

Using Time Module:
Conclusion: Code written using OO is slower than code written using dictionaries.

Performance comparison for grading operation (give in each line: value of N; time taken by two approaches in seconds, and which is faster and by how much).
1. N:1000
2. Time by OO:   26332.50594139099
3. Time by dictionary:   25950.22702217102
4. X is faster; fraction of time x took is: Dictionary
